Note:

- The "signing" context is blurry but could be related to Ensemble Stars events.
- "3 of us" probably refers to [<i class="fa-brands fa-youtube" /> Hiro Minamori (graduated)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuGMkxJA_icuiF01u8f3Y2Q)

![TOKOMACHI](./youtube/20190626_01.jpg)

> [<i class="fa-brands fa-youtube" /> Original YouTube Stream](https://youtu.be/Kr1jxq0ms00)

The naming logic is:

<p style="text-align: center;">
    Inui<span style="color:#e93320; font-weight:bold;"> Toko</span> + Hoshi<span style="color:#00b8ed; font-weight:bold; text-align: center;">machi </span>Suisei = <span style="color:#e93320; font-weight:bold;">Toko</span><span style="color:#00b8ed; font-weight:bold;">machi</span>
</p>

[13:38](https://youtu.be/Kr1jxq0ms00&t=818s) Suisei and Toko were amused when seeing a wolf (dog) trying to get its fur dry

[14:23](https://youtu.be/Kr1jxq0ms00&t=863s) Suisei asked Toko to do the same and Toko followed. Toko actually doesn't like being called a _dog_ but she still followed.

## Turning Point

### Virtual to Live 2019

![VtL](./youtube/vtl.jpg)

Full event name [Virtual to LIVE in 両国国技館 2019](https://event.nijisanji.app/vtlryougoku2019/)

This was the first time for Inui Toko to attend a full 3D live, where she sang Chiisaki Mono (小さきもの).

According to Suisei's YouTube after talk stream (privated), Suisei watched the whole live and was astonished by Toko's performance.

### Non-Stop Story

![Non-stop Story 00](./youtube/nss.jpg)

Full event name [hololive 1st fes. ノンストップ・ストーリー](https://www.nonstop.hololive.tv/)

This was the major turning point for Suisei.

Her original plan was to sing [<i class="fa-solid fa-meteor" /> _Comet_](https://youtu.be/3cqV5BKJHyk) there. But after seeing Toko's live performance, she changed her mind and went for more _impact_, thus the song she chose to sing on stage was [<i class="fa-solid fa-meteor" /> _Tenkyuu, Suisei wa Yoru wo Mataide_](https://youtu.be/zLak0dxBKpM). The song and her performance was so impressive that her name was on Twitter Trend for a pretty long time.

![Non-stop Story 01](./youtube/nss_suisei_01.jpg)

![Non-stop Story 02](./youtube/nss_suisei_02.jpg)

She gained popularity after the event rapidly and started trending.

### Toko's Response

According to Toko, the most impressive part was Suisei's [<i class="fa-solid fa-meteor" /> _Tenkyuu, Suisei wa Yoru wo Mataide_](https://youtu.be/zLak0dxBKpM) and she was so moved that she cried. She said she became Suisei's fan girl and send LINE messages to Suisei right after watching the live.

Toko was also very happy to know her performance inspired Suisei.

::: tip Toko's impressions on Suisei

- Good at singing
- She never gives up or compromises on what she aimed for
- I admire her a lot

Suisei appeared in the stream chat later when Toko was talking about Ensemble Stars. Toko said _Hoshimachi! Sui-chan! Here comes our beloved singer_ and was pretty shy and unsure whether Suisei heard her praising Suisei's performance.

:comet: : You praised my performance? I will check the archive later!

:tropical_drink: : OK I will cut that part.

:tropical_drink: : Oh wait don't go, I still got something about EnSta to tell you!

:comet: : Tell me more on LINE!

Really close friends right?

## Summary of 2019

Suisei and Toko knew each other in 2019 and they were already pretty close friends by then.

They started the unit <span style="color:#e93320; font-weight:bold;">Toko</span><span style="color:#00b8ed; font-weight:bold;">machi</span> on 2019-06-26.

Toko's performance inspired Suisei, and Suisei's performance on Non-Stop Story became her major turning point. That could be the reason why they cherish each other a lot.
