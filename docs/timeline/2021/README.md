This was the first Tokomachi collab in 3D, held in [<i class="fa-brands fa-youtube" /> HIMASHOKUDO Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCom8rCUQZP98SIXJzMwjrxw/).

Both of them were funny and joked on the 2 hosts from the beginning till the end.

Although it was a rather casual stream having Tokomachi trying out the dished made by the hosts and answering some questions, this was the first time having NIJISANJI, hololive 3D and another agency's 3D model collab together.

This was the first step they took and a preparation for the upcoming live.

## Voice change

Suisei bumped into the problem of a continuous sore throat from the end of 2020. According to her doctor the problem originated from her voice acting. She thought for a long time and painfully decided to use her daily voice for streaming.

She announced the change and the reason on stream.

From what was said on Tokomachi Radio, she consulted Toko about what might happen and how should she tell her audiences about that. Toko also encouraged her a lot, since it would be good for her in the longer term.

## Teach me please Tokomachi

### 2021-06-06

> [<i class="fa-brands fa-youtube" /> Original YouTube Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQB79VAyWAw)

This was a chatting stream talking about _Ensemble Stars_ series specifically for 4 whole hours.

The length of the stream was pretty uncommon for both of them by that time. They showed how they loved the franchise there. According to themselves, it was like what they do in their daily life talking with each other about EnSta.

> [<i class="fa-brands fa-youtube" /> _Timestamp: Toko singing a little bit Tenkyuu_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzM4du2xWXo&t=3800s)

In this Toko karaoke stream, some audiences asked whether Toko would sing _Tsubasa Moratorium_ with Suisei so Toko did a shout-out, calling Suisei to sing it with her. Unexpectedly, Suisei _was_ there and answered _YES!_

After that, Toko asked what would the audiences want to hear. She saw a comment saying _Tenkyuu_, she asked _Suisei is here so you want to hear that right?_ and then singed a short part of the song.

Suisei was still there and said _Hey sing more!_ and Toko answered _But you still didn't give me the instrumental version!_

Toko was invited to attend the [<i class="fa-solid fa-trophy"></i> Virtual Music Award 2021](http://www.vma2021.jp/).

The song selection was really unexpected.

- [<i class="fa-solid fa-meteor" /> _Tenkyuu, Suisei wa Yoru wo Mataide_](https://youtu.be/zLak0dxBKpM), Hoshimachi Suisei
- [<i class="fa-solid fa-ghost" /> _GHOST_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKKar5SS29E), Hoshimachi Suisei (feat. w/ Mememe)

And the MC talk of Toko was so moving.

::: details MC talk

The next song I'm going to sing as solo.

The song is from Hoshimachi Suisei, I like her and admire her so much.

Please listen, _Tenkyuu, Suisei wa Yoru wo Mataide_.

:::

This is also the first time Toko singing Suisei's song.

This event was the first time Toko attended as the only talent and as a solo singer from NIJISANJI. This is a huge step for her since most events she went as Sanbaka (w/ Lize Helesta and Ange Katerina).

### After Talk

> [<i class="fa-brands fa-youtube" /> _Timestamp: About Tenkyuu and GHOST_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxK7WHO5Y7k&t=1448s)

#### About Tenkyuu

Toko said she insisted firmly that _she definitely wants to sing Tenkyuu_.

After got the go sign from the live concert committee, she told Suisei about that and Suisei answered happyily _Oh of course you can sing that!_

Toko also mentioned that _Tenkyuu_ was the first Suisei's song she heard. She loved the song itself and she thought the song was somehow special. Also Toko mentioned that Suisei said she was influenced by her performance in VtL, this time she did this in return.

_For more information, please read [<i class="fa-solid fa-microphone-lines" /> Timeline: 2019, Turning Point](/timeline/2019/#turning-point)._

#### About GHOST

Toko singed [<i class="fa-solid fa-ghost" /> _GHOST_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKKar5SS29E) with [<i class="fa-brands fa-twitter"></i> Mokota Mememe](https://twitter.com/mokomeme_ch). They were so excited that they even waved to the camera and asked _Hey Sui-chan are you watching?_

Tho, unfortunately Suisei was on an hololive official stream that time. So they told Suisei about that after the live concert.

She thought _GHOST_ was a impressive song.

## Tokomachi Radio 1st Anniversary

### 2021-10-30

![1st Anniversary](../../topics/tokomachi_radio_s01/top_s1.jpg)

Tokomachi Radio finally reached its 1st Anniversary.

It was a perfect run for the first year even most of the episodes after Feb. 2021 were not held on the 4th Wednesday of every month. Considering their full schedule and Tokomachi Radio itself was a passion project, the run was impressive.

_For more information, please read [<i class="fa-solid fa-microphone-lines" /> Topics: Tokomachi Radio Episode 13](/topics/tokomachi_radio_s01/#episode-13-1st-anniversary)._

## Summary

2021 Tokomachi took another big step forward. They got their first public 3D collab and live appearance, Suisei also invited to her 1st solo live as a return and said inviting Toko meant she wanted to forge her future with Toko, also breaking the walls between agencies. So far they were considered _the icon_ of inter-agencies cooperations.

Although there were nearly totally nothing after Suisei's 1st solo live because their schedules were totally full, even had no time for Tokomachi Radio (got 2 episodes delayed), but we still can expect for further progressions in 2022.

Like Suisei said before, it was mutual respect, they all have their solo works to do and the best way was to support each other properly.
