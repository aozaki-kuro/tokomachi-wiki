This was the first Tokomachi collab in 3D, held in [<i class="fa-brands fa-youtube" /> HIMASHOKUDO Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCom8rCUQZP98SIXJzMwjrxw/).

Both of them were funny and joked on the 2 hosts from the beginning till the end.

Although it was a rather casual stream having Tokomachi trying out the dished made by the hosts and answering some questions, this was the first time having NIJISANJI, hololive 3D and another agency's 3D model collab together.

This was the first step they took and a preparation for the upcoming live.

## Teach me please Tokomachi

### 2021-06-06

> [<i class="fa-brands fa-youtube" /> Original YouTube Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQB79VAyWAw)

This was a chatting stream talking about _Ensemble Stars_ series specifically for 4 whole hours.

The length of the stream was pretty uncommon for both of them by that time. They showed how they loved the franchise there. According to themselves, it was like what they do in their daily life talking with each other about EnSta.

## Summary

2021 Tokomachi took another big step forward. They got their first public 3D collab and live appearance, Suisei also invited to her 1st solo live as a return and said inviting Toko meant she wanted to forge her future with Toko, also breaking the walls between agencies. So far they were considered _the icon_ of inter-agencies cooperations.

Although there were nearly totally nothing after Suisei's 1st solo live because their schedules were totally full and even had no time for Tokomachi Radio (got 2 episodes delayed), but we still can expect for further leaps in 2022.

Like Suisei said before, it was mutual respect, they all have their solo works to do and the best way was to support each other properly.
