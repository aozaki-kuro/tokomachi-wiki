This is Hoshimachi Suisei's first ever radio program. The program focuses on music, and singing cover songs was one of its major segments. During it's run, Suisei invited a lot of Vtubers, singers and music-related talents to the program.

The program started on April 4th, 2020 and was discontinued on March 28th, 2021 due to the program reform of Bunka Housou.

> [<i class="fab fa-youtube" /> Original YouTube Stream ](https://youtu.be/8b7WYQ2vvSA&t=4873s)

Suisei was on a [<i class="fa-brands fa-twitter" /> one week-long break ](https://twitter.com/suisei_hosimati/status/1262763428931702790) but she appeared in Inui Toko's Minecraft Server while she was on stream unexpectedly. It was an informal collab, so Suisei had her mic off and only communicated via Minecraft chat.

Toko was also surprised to see her since Suisei should have been on break. During this time, Suisei fished and was fished in return by Toko, and she also showed off her *Lightspeed Idol Outfit Change*. It's been a long time since Suisei last played Minecraft, so it seemed like she had already forgotten how to play, however she still managed to act in a funny way and made Toko laugh a lot.

Suisei promoted for her radio program tomorrow since Toko would be the guest. 

::: details The conversation and reactions

:comet: : *Here I come!* (started to *fish* Toko with her fishing rod)

:comet: : *Everybody, please listen to my radio program!*

:tropical_drink: : *Well, she is that kind of idol who won't forgot to promote for her own program even when she's on her vacation.*

:tropical_drink: : *Are you having a good time Hoshimachi?*

:comet: (Still trying to fish Toko happily)

:tropical_drink: : *Alright, it seems like she's having a good time*

This was the first time Suisei invited a non-Hololive talent to her radio program.

They mentioned the place they want to go together was *Tokyo Disney Land*, and while they were there, Toko wanted to go to the Gourmet Tour in *Tokyo Disney Land*.

::: details About Toko's ears

(Talking about wearing the Mickey Mouse ears)

:comet: : *So there would be two kinds of ears...  what would happen to your dog-like ears...*

:tropical_drink: : *Not dog. Cerberus.*

:comet: : *Well then what should we call the ear of Cerberus (nani mimi)?*

:tropical_drink: : *Cerberus ears (keru mimi).*

:comet: : *First time hearing (hatsu mimi)!*


Note:
- *Don't* even try to call Toko a dog, she *doesn't* like it.
- Cerberus ears = Keruberus Mimi

::: details Live performance

Toko mentioned that she didn't just want to *sing together*, but also to *dance together*.

Suisei said her favorite part of Toko is she always laughs so happily. On the other hand, Toko mentioned that Suisei also laughs a lot. Their conversations were able to stay alive for long periods of time and they gained a lot of common language because of this.

Suisei really liked Toko's performance on Virtual to Live 2019. Toko also invited Suisei to watch the *Blu-ray* replay together at home.

:::

::: details Toko curious about Anemachi

Toko thought Anemachi (Suisei's elder sister) was pretty funny. Anemachi often shows up, not just during their the last collab gacha stream, but she also shows up when Suisei's going on long calls with Toko at night. Anemachi even invited Toko to go the *Tokyo Disney Land* together.

Suisei said that she was influenced by Anemachi into becoming an Otaku. Toko said that it seemed like it's because of Anemachi that they can can meet each other.

Toko also has an elder sister who she affectionately calls Aneberos, and that she also got influenced by her elder sister into reading Manga and watching anime, just like Suisei.

:::

::: details What should we eat?

Suisei and Toko often go for a meal (mainly Yakiniku) in 2019. Suisei always decided on the food pretty fast since she's mainly interested in meat and beef.

For their next meal, they quickly decided that it should be [<i class="fa-brands fa-wikipedia-w" /> Shabushabu ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabu-shabu)

:::

::: details Feeling nervous on stage?

A fan letter asked whether there were monsters on the stage (whether they would feel nervous on live concert stage), Toko and Suisei said they are more excited than nervous when seeing the audiences and the glow sticks in their hands. 

Even when there are, it seemed like Toko would *politely eat them up* since she is the *mighty mighty Cerberus*.

This is the first time Suisei and Toko being able to sing together on air. Since Bunka Housou is able to solve the copyright, they chose not only Yorushika, but also EnSta songs.

EnSta / Happy Element is well-known for a very strict copyright guideline.

The songs they singed in this episode were
- [<i class="fab fa-youtube" /> Hana ni Bourei, Yorushika ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgOe9gVype0)

In the talking part, they did a simple "psychological test".

::: details "Psychological test"

Q: The color of the cup that you would give to your friend when she's paying a visit to your house. The color you choose might indicates the relationship between you and your friend. `A. Green`, `B. Orange`, `C. Blue`, `D. Pink`

Toko selected `C. Blue`

Suisei selected `D. Pink`

`C. Blue` : If there are troubles, you would help her out and she would do the same. When you are in trouble, you often ask for help from her don't you? And when she's in trouble you would help her out without hesitation.

`D. Pink` : You often share happiness with her. Did you often go shopping or having meals with her? Sometimes you share new info or go to new scenic spots with each other. She always can cheer you up.

Toko and Suisei agreed on this is pretty accurate and this is *teetee*.

:::

Suisei mentioned every time she talked with Toko end up in laughing a lot with Toko. Suisei really love Toko's jokes and topics.

The songs they singed in this episode were
- [<i class="fab fa-youtube" /> Kaze wa Yokoku naku Fuku, Walküre ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLxHpZv8wLA)
- [<i class="fab fa-youtube" /> Mémoire Antique, Valkyrie (Ensemble Stars!) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo24u1KBB0U)

### Reason why Suisei likes Toko

> [<i class="fab fa-youtube" /> Original YouTube Stream ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I58nqKO2fak&t=2547s)

Suisei talked about the MUSIC RADIO episode in the own chatting stream.

And the reason why Suisei really likes Toko
- Toko is always interesting and positive.
- Toko can make Suisei laugh a lot.
- Toko often joke on Suisei and the jokes won't be over-the-line.
- Beside jokes, Toko also praise and support Suisei a lot.
- Mutual respect. Even they have known each other for more than a year and became pretty close friends, they can still keep a proper distance and won't let each other feel uncomfortable.

Suisei also asked the clippers not to clip this because she felt pretty shy and worried about if Toko would see this. Well, the clip still got noticed by Toko and [something even more interesting](/timeline/2021/) happened a year later.

## Totsumachi

Suisei called in and said *happy birthday* to Toko, and they also talked about a lot of other topics.

#### First impression

When talking about *How Suisei knew Toko*, Suisei said it was her indie days, someone (refers to [<i class="fab fa-youtube" /> Hiro Minamori (graduated) ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuGMkxJA_icuiF01u8f3Y2Q)) introduced Toko to Suisei.

Suisei's first impression of Toko was *Huh that traditional Japanese style Nijisanji girl!*

#### Teasing

On October 26th, 2020 Suisei tweeted and mentioned she would have an announcement but not on her own channel.

#### Announcement

That night 20:00 JST Inui Toko started her Karaoke stream and the title said *I got some announcements*.

> [<i class="fab fa-youtube" /> Original YouTube Stream ](https://youtu.be/Q1t_vUj-fJQ&t=2068s)

Her first announcement was *her first original song was on its way*.

The second announcement was *Inui Toko 1st solo live \"who i am\"*  was going to be held on Dec 10th, 2020.

The most astonishing thing was *Hoshimachi Suisei appeared as one of the live guests*. It was the first time a Hololive member appeared on Nijisanji paid event / live concert so that was a big surprise.

According to Toko, all guests (Lize Helesta, Ange Katrina, Higuchi Kaede and **Hoshimachi Suisei**) are extremely important to her and that's why she invited them to her 1st solo live.

## Tokomachi Radio

### 2020-10-28

<br>
<img src="./youtube/tokomachi_radio_01.jpg" />

As Toko and Suisei succesfully came over the obstacles between 2 agencies, they decided to take it further and started Tokomachi Radio.

Tokomachi Radio is a monthly radio program, scheduled on the 3rd Wednesday of every month.

Although the radio wasn't actually always on time, they successfully made a perfect run in the first year.

Tokomachi's dreams

- Duo original songs
- Duo concert lives

There they also announced that their first cover song MV would be uploaded on Oct. 31st, 2020.

## First Tokomachi Cover MV

<img src="./youtube/20201031_01.jpg" />

> [<i class="fab fa-youtube" /> Suisei Channel ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhmFj1owmuk)

This was the first Tokomachi cover song MV uploaded to YouTube channel.

The song was from *Ensemble Stars! Album series Valkyrie*.

According to the comments, the song fits their image - cute but also sometimes be very handsome.

The song reached 1m replay in approximately a month. Considering EnSta is a rather unfamiliar genre for both Suisei and Toko's audiences, this is a pretty impressive record back in late 2020.

> [<i class="fab fa-youtube" /> Watchalong Stream ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYFl1QqQjq8)

They also had a watchalong stream. Since there were no latency when they shouted out *Kyou mo kawaii!* so this is highly possible an off collab.

They partially swapped their greetings.

::: details Toko's greetings

:tropical_drink: : *It's your shooting star...*

:comet: : *What?*

:tropical_drink: : *Your Cerberus in the rough...*

:comet: : *What??*

:tropical_drink: : *Inui Toko from Nijisanji!*

:comet: : LOOOOOOL

:::

They enjoyed the recording and wanted to do that for 5000 more times.
