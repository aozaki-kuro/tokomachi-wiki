### Choosing the Songs

Toko and Suisei said they decided what to sing pretty fast.

Mrs. GREEN APPLE was one of Toko's favorite singers and Yorushika's songs were the best choice considering the highest key Toko can reach.

Suisei also said she was the same type as Toko, they tend to have better conditions when singing on stage. They even got some synchronized movements on stage without any rehearsals.

### Backstage

Suisei and Toko always talking in the backstage. They even forgot to turn their mic off and Polka heard that. Polka's reaction was _Oh, uh, both of you are pretty interesting._

### Suisei Pizza

### Toko's Thoughts

Toko mentioned that she was so moved when seeing Suisei singing on the stage. She had to prevent herself from crying since it would affect her performance.

So she decided to think of some Suisei's very very embarrassing moments, according to Toko these were too embarrassing that she cannot say it publicly. Seeing the shining idol singing and dancing on stage and thinking of those, Toko felt a little bit _gap moe_.

Suisei asked _What are these? What have I done??_ and Toko said _It's a secret._

In the end they also did a shout-out that they want to do duo live concert.
