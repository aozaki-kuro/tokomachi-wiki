# DECREPTED

The project now uses a new framework so it's been moved to https://github.com/aozaki-kuro/tokomachi-wiki-neo

## What is this?

This is a Wikipedia-like site to record Tokomachi's activities and details.

## Support

If you found the project helpful, please consider buy me a coffee or support the server!
